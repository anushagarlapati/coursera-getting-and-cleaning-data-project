# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-project
course project for Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This repository is the submission for Nathan C. Walk, MD.  

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a 
data set.  Data is prepared in the form of "tidy data" for analysis later.  Tidy data is defined
in simple terms, by Hadley Wickham, as data sets that are arranged such that each variable is 
a column and each observation (or case) is a row.

Files:
1. Readme.txt is the file you are reading now.
2. Codebook.txt is the codebook for the R program and data that describes variables, data, and
	transformations made to clean up the data.
3. run_analysis.R is the program I prepared to meet the criteria set forth by the assignment:
	a. Merges training and test sets to create one data set.
	b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
	d. Appropriately lavels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	e. Creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each
		activity and each subject.
4. Data_final.txt is the exported final data in table format.

The data analyzed was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Here are the data for the project:
